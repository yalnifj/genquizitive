			<p>When you first come to the game you will be asked to login with your <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> and/or your 
				<a href="http://www.familysearch.org">FamilySearch</a> accounts.
			</p>
			<p>A <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> account is required to challenge your friends and family members, to play with hints,
			and to track your score and access leaderboards.  When you connect GenQuizitive to your Facebook account, we will use your account to 
			uniquely identify you and access your list of friends.  You will be asked for permission anytime something is shared with one of your friends
			or posted to your Facebook feed.<p>
			<p>A <a href="http://www.familysearch.org">FamilySearch</a> account is required to play with your personal family history. If you do not connect to a 
			<a href="http://www.familysearch.org">FamilySearch</a> account, then you may only play GenQuiz rounds in which others have challenged you.<p>
			<p>After you login, you will be shown the game's main menu.  Choose from one of the road signs to begin playing.</p>

				After clicking "Start" you will be presented with a question about your genealogy. <a href="questiontypes.html">Click here to learn more about our question types.</a>
				After answering this question correctly, you will be presented with another slightly more difficult question.  If you incorrectly answer a multiple choice
				question you will be given a penalty and a penalty light will turn on.  Each penalty will add 20 seconds to your total GenQuiz time.  The gauge shows how
				far you have progressed through the current GenQuiz round.

				The GenQuiz round ends after you correctly answer 5 questions.  You will then be shown your GenQuiz score.  Each question will be shown and the time it 
				took you to answer that question. You can learn more about the ancestor targeted in each question by clicking the ancestor badge next to the question. 
				This opens a window with all of the family tree details about that person.

				The option to "Challenge a Friend" will allow you to start a GenQuiz with one of your <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> friends.
				A <a href="http://www.familysearch.org">FamilySearch</a> account and a <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> account are required.</p>
			</p>
			<p>You will first be shown a screen where you may choose from one of your <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> friends who are also
				playing GenQuizitive.  Click on one of the friend badges to start a new GenQuiz with them.  To invite any of your other 
				<a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> friends to play with you, click on the "Invite Friends" button and search for the friend you
				would like to start a new GenQuiz with.

			</p>
			<p>After you complete the GenQuiz, your friend will receive a <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> request letting them know that it is their turn.
				If your friend is logged into their <a href="http://www.familysearch.org">FamilySearch</a> account, then they will play with the same questions but
				the data will be from their family tree.  If a question you answered targets a person that they also have in their family tree, then they will play 
				with that person. If they have not logged in to a family tree account, then they will see the same questions that you answered with the data from your
				family tree.  Questions will not target living people if you are playing with someone who does not have their own family tree account.

				The GenQuiz round ends after you correctly answer 5 questions.  You will then be shown your GenQuiz score.  If your friend has also completed this GenQuiz
				then their score will also be shown.  Each question will be shown and the time it took for you to answer that question. Each question will also show an ancestor 
				badge for the person who was the target of that question.  You can learn more about this ancestor by clicking on their ancestor badge. This open a window 
				with all of the family tree details about that person.

			to play.  Click on the GenQuiz to begin playing your turn.  Play is the same as described in the <a href="#challenge">Challenge a Friend</a> section.</p>
			<p>It will show you the GenQuiz rounds that you have completed, which rounds are waiting on your friend and which rounds your friend

			<p>You may win or purchase hints to help you during a GenQuiz.  This page describes each hint and what it does during the game.  The little circle on each hint shows 
			how many of those hints you have available to you. A <a href="http://www.facebook.com">Facebook</a> account is required to store the hints you have won.</p>
			<p>One way to win hints is by clicking the "Daily Hint!" button.  Clicking this button will check if you have made any recent changes to your family tree.  If you 
			have made changes, then you will be awarded a new hint.  Each day you make changes to your family tree will allow you win a new hint on that day.  This will 
			encourage you to improve your family tree each day.  It doesn't matter what change you make, any change will count.
			</p>
			<p>If a hint is available for a question, then that hint will show up under the gauge and question type letter on the GenQuiz question screen.  To use a hint, 
			simply click on it and it will be applied to the current question.</p>
