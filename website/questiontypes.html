			<p>Ancestor badges are shown in the large sign for 3 generations from your family tree.  The smaller signs below represent a small family tree: 
			the main person or child of the family belongs in the bottom box, the parents belong in the middle row of boxes, the grandparents fit in the top row of small boxes.			
			For example, the smaller sign at the top left is for the main person's father's father.  The top right sign is for the mother's mother.  To complete
			this question drag the ancestor badges from the top sign to their correct place in the family tree.  If a person is in the correct place, their sign
			will be outlined in yellow.  If they are in the incorrect place it will be outlined in red.</p>
			<p>Depending on the difficulty level of this question, some of the people may already be in their correct place when the question begins.
			There is no penalty for placing someone in the incorrect place except for the time it takes to remove them and place them somewhere else.</p>

			<p>This question randomly chooses a person from your tree and asks you to place all of their facts into their correct locations on a map.  To place a fact
			on the map, drag it from the top into the correct place on the map.  If you try to place a fact in the incorrect place, it will move back to the top.
			Use the standard Google map controls to pan around and zoom in and out on the map.  Each location is guaranteed to be unique and there will only be one fact per 
			place.  </p>
			<p>Some places may be too close to distinquish at the current zoom level and will be shown as a cluster with a number.  Zoom in to that location 
			until the unique places are visible in order to drag facts to locations that were in that cluster.  As you zoom out on the map, locations will merge into a cluster again.</p>
			<p>This question gets more difficult by choosing a person with more facts.</p>

			correct place on the map.  Each place is guaranteed to be unique, and there will only be one person born in a certain place.</p>
