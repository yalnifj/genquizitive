            <p>This privacy policy discloses the privacy practices for GenQuizitive. This
                privacy policy applies solely to information collected by GenQuizitive
                websites and applications. It will notify you of the following:</p>

            <ol>
                <li>What personally identifiable information is collected from you through the web
                    site, how it is used and with whom it may be shared.
                </li>
                <li>How we use cookies.</li>
                <li>What choices are available to you regarding the use of your data.</li>
                <li>The security procedures in place to protect the misuse of your information.</li>
                <li>How you can correct any inaccuracies in the information.</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Information Collection, Use, and Sharing&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>We only have access to/collect information that you voluntarily give us. We will only 
				store information about you for your use of the application.  Examples of information we
				store are high scores and the rounds you have played. We are the sole owners of any information stored
                during the use of the site or application.&nbsp;We will not sell or
                rent this information to anyone.</p>
			<p>If you connect
                a GenQuizitive application to your online family tree account, the
                data from that online family tree is only used temporarily as required to play 
				the game and will be deleted from servers and devices when it is no longer needed for game play. 
                Family Tree data will not be transmitted to any third parties.</p>

            <p>We will only contact you if you explicitly give us permission to by opting into a
                mailing or distribution list.</p>
            <p></p>
            <p>We may use your information to respond to you, regarding the reason you
                contacted us. We will not share your information with any third party outside of our
                organization, other than as necessary to fulfill your request.</p>

            <p></p>
            <h4>Cookie Policy&nbsp;</h4>
            <p>GenQuizitive web applications may use cookies to personalize information while you are playing a game.
            </p>
            <p>Third-party advertizers and social networks may use cookies to personalise content and ads and to provide 
                social media features. 
                Information about your use of our site may be shared with these third-parties who may combine 
                it with other information you’ve provided to them or they’ve collected from your use of their services.</p>
            <p></p>
            <h4>Your Access to and Control Over Information&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>You may opt out of any future contacts from us at any time. You can do the following
                at any time by contacting us via email:</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; See what data we have about you, if any.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Change/correct any data we have about you.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Have us delete any data we have about you.</p>

            <p></p>

            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&bull; Express any concern you have about our use of your data.</p>

            <p></p>

            <h4>Security&nbsp;</h4>

            <p>We take precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive
                information via the website, your information is protected both online and
                offline.</p>
            <p></p>

            <p>While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online, we also
                protect your information offline. Only employees who need the information to perform
                a specific job (for example, billing or customer service) are granted access to
                personally identifiable information. The computers/servers in which we store
                personally identifiable information are kept in a secure environment.</p>

            <p></p>

            <h4>Updates</h4>

            <p></p>

            <p></p>

            <p>Our Privacy Policy may change from time to time and all updates will be posted on
                this page.</p>
